**Definition:** Photo filters are digital tools used to enhance or alter the appearance of images by applying effects like color adjustments, contrast changes, or artistic transformations.
Types of Photo Filters:
Color Filters:

**Sepia:** Adds a warm, brownish tint to mimic old photographs.
Black & White: Removes all color, leaving only grayscale.
Warm/Cool Filters: Adjust temperature tones, making images look warmer (more yellow/orange) or cooler (more blue).
Brightness/Contrast Filters:

**Brightness:** Increases or decreases the overall lightness of an image.
Contrast: Adjusts the difference between dark and light areas to make the image pop or look flat.
Blur/Sharpen Filters:

**Blur**:Softens the image by reducing the sharpness, often used for portraits or to create depth.
Sharpen: Enhances the image clarity by emphasizing edges.
Vignette:

Adds a subtle darkening effect around the edges of the image to draw attention to the center.
Vintage/Retro Filters:

Simulate the look of older photos with faded colors, grain, and light leaks.
**Artistic Filters:**

**Cartoon/Sketch:** Turns photos into cartoon-like or hand-drawn images.
Oil Painting/Watercolor: Mimics traditional painting styles.
Noise Reduction Filters:

Reduces graininess or pixelation in images, often used in low-light photos.
HDR (High Dynamic Range):

Enhances both shadows and highlights for a more dramatic look, making the image appear more vibrant and detailed.
Saturation Filters:

Adjusts the intensity of colors. High saturation makes colors more vivid; low saturation can make them more muted.
Lens Flare/Light Filters:

Adds artificial light effects, such as lens flares, sunbursts, or soft glowing areas.
Applications:
**Social Media:** Widely used on platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok for personal or creative branding.
**Photo Editing Software:** Available in apps like Photoshop, Lightroom, and mobile editing apps for photographers.
Special Effects: Can create artistic or whimsical effects for a unique aesthetic.
**Use Cases:**
**Enhancing Portraits:** Smoothing skin, adjusting brightness/contrast, and adding artistic flair.
**Correcting Image Exposure:** Fixing photos that are too bright or too dark.
Creative Expression: Turning ordinary photos into art through effects like vintage, sepia, or surreal filters.
